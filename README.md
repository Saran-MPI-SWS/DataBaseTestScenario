DataBaseTestScenario
====================
We are performing database stress testing on PostgreSQL, as a part of one of our projects in Max Planck Institute for Software Systems in Kaiserslautern, Germany. 
We program java applications to implement different test scenarios on PostgreSQL, to see how costs of different database related operations change, as the database grows.  
Here you can find the java applicationsâ€™ codes and the test results and some brief description on each test.
